These scripts were part of my learning journey during the Studienkolleg, where I focused on enhancing my programming skills and understanding core computer science concepts. They serve as a reflection of my progress and the foundational knowledge I gained during this time.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the scripts as needed. This repository is open for educational purposes.
